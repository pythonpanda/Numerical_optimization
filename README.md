# [Optimization of Complex Systems  (Uni-hamburg, 2011 SS)](https://www.stine.uni-hamburg.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000360,-N0,-N341163414770989,-N341163414798990,-N0,-N0,-N0)

This lecture will emphasize on nonsmooth optimization problems. That is we will be concerned with convex optimization problems whose objective function is not continuously differentiable. This nonsmoothness gives rise to several complications both in theory as well as in computational methods for this problem class. The aim of this lecture is to give the participants an introduction to 
this topic and its differences and similarities to the smooth case. 


The content of the lecture includes: 
* Fundamentals of convex analysis 
* Subdifferential and epsilion-Subdifferential 
* Cutting plane algorithms 
* Bundle methods 
* Semi smooth newton methods 
* Regularization
